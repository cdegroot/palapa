# Idéfix

I needed a name for a fuzzy logic library, then my brain said "furry logic" and the name was
simple.

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert and my math is rusty. This may not be the best FL library in
the world ;-)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `idefix` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:idefix, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/idefix](https://hexdocs.pm/idefix).
