I got fed up of having my experiments, tools, libraries spread
out over lots of GH repos. Let's try one very large umbrella.

## Included apps

In alphabetical order:

* [Amnesix, a work scheduler using Kafka for persistence and distribution](apps/amnesix)
* [Entity-Component-System library, for games and maybe other things](apps/ecs)
* [Erix, a Raft implemenation that should be fit for production use](apps/erix)
* [Game related utilities](apps/exgame)
* [A Pong game using ECS](apps/pong)
* [Generic coding and test tools](apps/simpler)
* [Some helpers for using WX from Elixir](apps/wxex)

Some of these may end up on Hex, please check the individual package READMEs for
details.
