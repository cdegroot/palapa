  @moduledoc """
  World definition for Boids. We stash the locations and directions of
  all boids in a central location for easy access. It is in essence a
  blackboard where Boids keep their position for others to act on.

  The world is modelled as a torus with x and y coordinates in the interval [0, 1] as
  floating points. The neighbourhood radius is fixed (see `@neighbourhood_radius`) and
  determines how far away a boid will check for neighbours to handle its behaviour.

  Implementation notes: initially, I started using an r-tree library but I wasn't
  super happy about the result. A plain ETS table with a full table scan for fetches
  turned out to be quicker. Especially using match specifications, the ETS was
  much faster.
