# Lfdsl

Lisp Flavored DSL. Trying to see how you can run a dynamic DSL (statements get
read and compiled at run-time) using LFE.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `lfdsl` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
