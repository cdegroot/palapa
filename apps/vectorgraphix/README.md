# Vectorgraphix

**TODO: Invent Asterix character named vectorgraphix**

Vectorgraphix is an idea at the moment, nothing more. Maybe some code will follow. 

The idea is to have an Elixir GUI in the following way:

* An executable that listens on an Erlang port and includes [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg)
* A library in Elixir that roughly replicates [NanoGUI](https://github.com/wjakob/nanogui)

The reason to separate the vector graphics and the GUI are multiple:
* With the OpenGL stuff in a separate executable, it can crash without taking down BEAM. Restart strategies are possible;
* The interesting bits are kept in Elixir and thus will be modifiable, etcetera. There's a ton of fun stuff you can do when your widget library is truly native and you have a code environment that's dynamic. See Morphic, Lively Kernel, etcetera. 
* I'd like to abuse the opportunity to see whether the widgets can be generated by a DSL, pulling all the stops on macros and maybe some more advanced parsing as well.

Steps:

* [ ] Build a basic wrapper executable
* [ ] Open a window, show a triangle
* [ ] Receive a mouseclick
* [ ] Lots and lots and lots of hard work to tie everything together.
