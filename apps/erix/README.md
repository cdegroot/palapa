# Erix

Erix is one of the pirates in Asterix, the son of the captain. As such, he
has intimate knowledge of rafts.

This is a fully TDD implementation of Raft, using RocksDB for persistence. The
tests follow the condensed summary of the protocol in Figure 2 of [the Raft paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)
